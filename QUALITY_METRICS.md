# LLM Lab - Quality Metrics Documentation

## Overview

The LLM Lab system implements five custom quality metrics to evaluate LLM responses programmatically. These metrics provide objective, quantitative measures of response quality across different dimensions, enabling systematic comparison of different parameter combinations.

## Metric Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Objectivity**: Metrics are calculated programmatically without human bias
2. **Comprehensiveness**: Cover multiple dimensions of response quality
3. **Scalability**: Efficient algorithms that work with responses of any length
4. **Interpretability**: Clear scoring that correlates with human judgment
5. **Customizability**: Configurable weights and thresholds

### Scoring System

- **Range**: All metrics score from 0.0 to 1.0
- **Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate better quality
- **Normalization**: Scores are normalized to ensure consistent interpretation
- **Weighted Average**: Overall score combines all metrics with configurable weights

## Detailed Metric Explanations

### 1. Coherence Score

#### Purpose

Measures the logical flow and consistency of the response text.

#### Formula

```
Coherence Score = (Connector Score + Pronoun Score + Topic Score) / 3
```

#### Components

##### Connector Score (0-1)

```typescript
connectorScore = Math.min(connectorCount / (sentenceCount * 0.3), 1.0);
```

- **Connectors**: Words like "however", "therefore", "furthermore", "moreover"
- **Target Ratio**: 0.3 connectors per sentence (optimal for readability)
- **Penalty**: Scores above 1.0 are capped at 1.0

##### Pronoun Score (0-1)

```typescript
pronounScore = 1.0 - unclearPronouns / totalPronouns;
```

- **Clear Pronouns**: Pronouns with clear antecedents
- **Unclear Pronouns**: Pronouns without clear referents
- **Penalty**: Deducts points for ambiguous pronoun usage

##### Topic Score (0-1)

```typescript
topicScore = 1.0 - topicShifts / sentenceCount;
```

- **Topic Shifts**: Abrupt changes in subject matter
- **Penalty**: Deducts points for excessive topic changes
- **Threshold**: More than 0.2 topic shifts per sentence reduces score

#### Example Calculation

```
Response: "The weather is nice today. However, it might rain later. Therefore, we should bring umbrellas."
- Connector Score: 2 connectors / 3 sentences * 0.3 = 0.67
- Pronoun Score: 1.0 (no unclear pronouns)
- Topic Score: 1.0 (no topic shifts)
- Coherence Score: (0.67 + 1.0 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.89
```

#### Limitations

- **Language Dependency**: Optimized for English text
- **Context Ignorance**: Doesn't consider external context
- **Subjectivity**: Some coherence judgments are inherently subjective

### 2. Completeness Score

#### Purpose

Evaluates how well the response addresses the original prompt.

#### Formula

```
Completeness Score = (Keyword Coverage + Question Answering + Task Fulfillment) / 3
```

#### Components

##### Keyword Coverage (0-1)

```typescript
keywordCoverage =
  (matchedKeywords / totalKeywords) * 0.6 +
  (responseLength / expectedLength) * 0.4;
```

- **Keywords**: Important terms extracted from the prompt
- **Matched Keywords**: Keywords that appear in the response
- **Response Length**: Actual response length
- **Expected Length**: Estimated appropriate response length

##### Question Answering (0-1)

```typescript
questionScore = answeredQuestions / totalQuestions;
```

- **Questions**: Interrogative sentences in the prompt
- **Answered Questions**: Questions that receive direct responses
- **Direct Response**: Response contains answer to the question

##### Task Fulfillment (0-1)

```typescript
taskScore = completedTasks / totalTasks;
```

- **Tasks**: Action verbs and instructions in the prompt
- **Completed Tasks**: Tasks that are addressed in the response
- **Task Types**: "explain", "describe", "compare", "analyze", etc.

#### Example Calculation

```
Prompt: "Explain the concept of artificial intelligence and describe its applications."
Response: "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. AI applications include machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision."

- Keyword Coverage: "artificial intelligence" (2/2) = 1.0
- Question Answering: "explain" and "describe" both addressed = 1.0
- Task Fulfillment: Both tasks completed = 1.0
- Completeness Score: (1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0) / 3 = 1.0
```

#### Limitations

- **Keyword Extraction**: May miss important concepts
- **Task Recognition**: Limited to common task verbs
- **Context Understanding**: Doesn't understand complex instructions

### 3. Length Score

#### Purpose

Assesses whether the response length is appropriate for the prompt.

#### Formula

```
Length Score = 1.0 - |log(responseLength / optimalLength)|
```

#### Components

##### Optimal Length Calculation

```typescript
optimalLength = promptLength * optimalRatio;
optimalRatio = 2.5; // Configurable ratio
```

##### Length Scoring

```typescript
lengthScore = Math.max(
  0,
  1.0 - Math.abs(Math.log(responseLength / optimalLength))
);
```

#### Scoring Logic

- **Optimal Range**: 2-5x the prompt length
- **Penalty**: Exponential penalty for deviations from optimal
- **Minimum Score**: 0.0 for extremely short or long responses
- **Maximum Score**: 1.0 for responses at optimal length

#### Example Calculation

```
Prompt: "What is AI?" (3 words)
Optimal Length: 3 * 2.5 = 7.5 words
Response: "AI is artificial intelligence that simulates human thinking." (9 words)
Length Score: 1.0 - |log(9/7.5)| = 1.0 - 0.18 = 0.82
```

#### Limitations

- **Content Quality**: Doesn't consider content quality, only length
- **Prompt Complexity**: Simple prompts may not need long responses
- **Subject Matter**: Different topics may require different lengths

### 4. Structure Score

#### Purpose

Evaluates the organization and structure of the response.

#### Formula

```
Structure Score = (Paragraph Score + Introduction Score + Conclusion Score) / 3
```

#### Components

##### Paragraph Score (0-1)

```typescript
paragraphScore = Math.min(paragraphCount / optimalParagraphs, 1.0);
optimalParagraphs = Math.ceil(responseLength / 100); // 100 words per paragraph
```

##### Introduction Score (0-1)

```typescript
introductionScore = hasIntroduction ? 1.0 : 0.0;
hasIntroduction = firstSentence.length > 20 && containsTopicWords;
```

##### Conclusion Score (0-1)

```typescript
conclusionScore = hasConclusion ? 1.0 : 0.0;
hasConclusion = lastSentence.length > 15 && containsSummaryWords;
```

#### Example Calculation

```
Response: "Artificial intelligence is transforming industries. It enables automation and improves efficiency. In conclusion, AI will continue to shape our future."
- Paragraph Score: 1 paragraph / 1 optimal = 1.0
- Introduction Score: First sentence introduces topic = 1.0
- Conclusion Score: Last sentence concludes = 1.0
- Structure Score: (1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0) / 3 = 1.0
```

#### Limitations

- **Style Dependency**: Assumes certain writing styles
- **Content Quality**: Doesn't evaluate content quality within structure
- **Cultural Bias**: May favor certain writing conventions

### 5. Vocabulary Score

#### Purpose

Measures vocabulary diversity and sophistication.

#### Formula

```
Vocabulary Score = (Diversity Score + Sophistication Score + Repetition Score) / 3
```

#### Components

##### Diversity Score (0-1)

```typescript
diversityScore = uniqueWords / totalWords;
```

##### Sophistication Score (0-1)

```typescript
sophisticationScore = sophisticatedWords / totalWords;
sophisticatedWords = words.length > 6 && !commonWords.includes(word);
```

##### Repetition Score (0-1)

```typescript
repetitionScore = 1.0 - (repeatedWords / totalWords)
repeatedWords = words that appear more than 3 times
```

#### Example Calculation

```
Response: "The sophisticated algorithm demonstrates remarkable efficiency and effectiveness."
- Diversity Score: 8 unique words / 8 total words = 1.0
- Sophistication Score: 3 sophisticated words / 8 total words = 0.375
- Repetition Score: 1.0 (no repeated words)
- Vocabulary Score: (1.0 + 0.375 + 1.0) / 3 = 0.79
```

#### Limitations

- **Language Dependency**: Optimized for English vocabulary
- **Subject Matter**: Technical terms may be unfairly penalized
- **Context Ignorance**: Doesn't consider appropriate vocabulary for context

```typescript
overallScore =
  coherenceScore * 0.25 +
  completenessScore * 0.25 +
  lengthScore * 0.2 +
  structureScore * 0.15 +
